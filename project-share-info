# Project: Share Info

## Goals:

1. **Share information accurately, and quickly.**
2. Use QR codes (technical goal: learning, skill building, resume padding...)

## Flows

### User readies the information for sharing: create QR code

1. User enters their information:
    1. name
    2. email
    3. phone number
    4. office address
    5. youtube channel, instagram handle, ...
    6. ...
    7. whatever data they want to share...
2. Create a QR code of it.

### Reading others' information: reading QR code

1. Point camera to other user's QR code
2. App will read it
3. App will store it with timestamp, and possibly (if permitted) with location

## Use Case 1

Suppose I go to a networking event, or a meetup, and I want to share my information
with others, and I want to remember or hold on to their information. This needs to be
fast, and accurate and hassle free.

I can write down, but handwriting might cause issues. And it is slow.

Using tech I would like to do that fast and properly.
